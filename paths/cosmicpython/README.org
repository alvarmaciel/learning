#+title: Readme

* CosmicPython
A study Guide. I will read and make every excercise of [Architecture Patterns with Python(A.K.A: Cosmic Puthon)](https://www.cosmicpython.com/).

** Constrains
- Every test will be made using pytest
- Instead of Flask I will use FastAPI
- All will be Async
- In the case that can be use more advance features it will be used (ie: pattern match, protocols)
- I will not use LLM's for this project. All old school read and search
** Notes.
All notes will be made using an orgmode notebook on this repo.
** Repo Management
- One branch for every chapter. Same nomenclature as the book
