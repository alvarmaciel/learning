#+title: Readme

* CosmicPython
A study Guide. I will read and make every excercise of [[https://www.cosmicpython.com/][Architecture Patterns with Python (A.K.A: Cosmic Puthon)]].

** Constrains
- Every test will be made using pytest
- API endpoint will be graphql
- Instead of Flask I will use FastAPI
- All will be Async
- In the case that can be use more advance features it will be used (ie: pattern match, protocols)
- I will not use LLM's for this project. All old school read and search
** Notes.
All notes will be made using an orgmode notebook on this repo.
** Repo Management
- One branch for every chapter. Same nomenclature as the book
** Chaper 1: Domain Model
- Write a few unit tests to see if you can capture the essence of these business rules in nice, clean code.
